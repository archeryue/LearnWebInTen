# Day 2: Basically Understanding of Vue.js

## Where to start?
 - the official site(vuejs.org) is pretty good for me.

## What is Vue.js?
 - Looks like it's a javascript framework to enhance html and make it much easier to interact with javascript.
 - Two core features of Vue.js: Declarative Rendering and Reactivity.
    - Declarative Rendering: we can declaratively describe html output base on javascript state.
    - Reactivity: vue will reactively update the DOMs when the javascript state changes.
 - They call vue.js "the progressive framework". Honestly speaking, I don't get it.
